![image-20200816205949529](img\ss)



A simple game made by me using JS, just a good challange for this week to learn about canvas HTML5.

Many thing that I learn from this, from a pain to ROTATE a THING at canvas and how to make collision detection (to detect the bird if touch the obstacles).

Btw, assets of this game made by me too, you can find *.psd file at assets folder.

## How to Install

Install Ubuntu 19.69, tensorflow and spotify to listen some good music.

No need to install anything, just open index.html using your favorit browser.
